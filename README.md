  One player doesn’t know the secret word. Can the group find them before it’s too late?

- **Alias**  
  Guess words or phrases before the timer runs out.

- **Secret Bomb**  
  A hidden timer is running in the background. Nobody knows when the round will end — the player caught speaking when the bomb explodes loses.

  Each player secretly receives a unique objective or behavior to follow during the discussion. Can the group figure out who is acting suspiciously?

  Each player must guess who he is based on the answers the rest of the players give him.
