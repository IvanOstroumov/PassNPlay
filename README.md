## 🎲 Games Included

- **Undercover**  
  Players choose the number of players and a word pack (or add custom words). Each player gets a word, but one player does not know it. Players discuss pass-and-play style. At the end, a player can be eliminated, and the Undercover player can try to guess the secret word.

- **Alias**  
  Players are divided into two teams. Each turn, one player explains words from their screen to teammates without using root or derivative words. Words can be marked as “explained” or “skipped”. Teams alternate turns, switching the explainer each round. The team that explains the most words correctly wins.

- **Secret Bomb**  
  A topic is chosen (e.g., “Animals starting with B”). Players take turns saying words on the topic. A hidden timer runs, and when it stops, the player currently speaking loses.

- **Private Missions**  
  Each player receives a secret modifier specifying with whom they must interact. Players communicate without revealing their missions. The winner is the player who correctly guesses other players’ modifiers.

- **Who am I?**  
  Each player is secretly assigned a word by the others. Players take turns asking one yes/no question per turn. If the answer is “yes”, they can ask up to three questions in total. If “no”, the turn passes to the next player. Players try to guess their secret word.

- **Secret Fact**  
  Each player reveals a fact about themselves. One player is assigned a fake fact generated by the site. Other players must guess who has the artificial fact.
